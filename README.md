This repository contains data and tools for exploring the linguistic typology of templatic constructions described in the form of graphs representing attribute-value matrices. It is associated with a forthcoming book to be published by Cambridge University Press entitled *The linguistic typology of templates* (http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/languages-linguistics/grammar-and-syntax/linguistic-typology-templates) authored by Jeff Good, who can be contacted for further information at jcgood@buffalo.edu.

The book contains detailed discussion of the theoretical motivations informing the construction of the database and scripts in this repository. Here, the scripts and data used in the study are briefly described and made available for those wishing to verify the results described in the book or wishing to adapt the methods or data used in the book for their own purposes. The materials here were not formally reviewed as part of the publication process for the book, and they are not intended to be straightforwardly deployed for new projects. The author would be happy to consider working with anyone seeking to use them for testing purposes or who would like to engage in a more formal collaboration.

Please note that the software and associated materials here have been released into the public domain to the extent that this legally allowed. If, for some reason, you believe that any material here has been released erroneously, please contact the author. The release of these materials into the public domain is not meant to relieve any user of the responsibility for adhering to accepted scholarly norms of citation.

Descriptions of each file/folder are as follows, divided across categories of primary resources and secondary resources. The latter class of resources are generated from the primary resources automatically.
