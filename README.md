This repository contains data and tools for exploring the linguistic typology of templatic constructions described in the form of graphs representing attribute-value matrices. It is associated with a forthcoming book to be published by Cambridge University Press entitled *The linguistic typology of templates* authored by Jeff Good, who can be contacted for further information at jcgood@buffalo.edu. The book contains detailed discussion of the theoretical motivations informing the construction of the database and scripts in this repository. Here, the scripts and data used in the study are briefly described and made available for those wishing to verify the results described in the book or wishing to adapt the methods or data used in the book for their own purposes.

Descriptions of each file/folder are as follows, divided across categories of primary resources and secondary resources. The latter class of resources are generated from the primary resources automatically.

Primary resources
-----------------

-InternalMaterials: This directory contains various resources used in the creation of the book mentioned above, and included in the repository to assist my own project management, but which are only indirectly connected to the research questions that most of the materials in this repository are intended to explore. Because of this, I do not describe the individual files in this directory here.

-LICENSE: The license for these materials. They are placed in the public domain to the extent that this is legally allowable. I still request that, if you use the materials here, their contribution is acknowledged, in particular in scholarly works, following usual practice.
